Bufler is like a butler for your buffers, presenting them to you in an
organized way based on your instructions.  The instructions are written
as grouping rules in a simple language, allowing you to customize the
way buffers are grouped.  The default rules are designed to be generally
useful, so you don’t have to write your own.

1 Screenshots
*************

In the default Emacs theme:

   This screenshot compares Bufler and Ibuffer showing the same buffers
with the default settings.  Note how Bufler allows commands to be
applied to an entire group of buffers: for example, pressing k in the
Bufler list would kill all the buffers in the group
Project: ~/src/emacs/bufler.el (and, of course, since it calls
kill-buffer, any unsaved ones would ask to be saved first).

   This screenshot shows group faces themed by prism
(https://github.com/alphapapa/prism.el), which Bufler optionally
supports.  (*Note:* This screenshot is of an older version of the
package, but is still accurate except for the name.)

3 Usage
*******

Run one of these commands.  You can customize settings in the bufler
group.

‘bufler’
     Show the Bufler buffer list.
‘bufler-mode’
     Enable the Bufler workspace mode, which allows each frame to have a
     chosen workspace from Bufler’s groups.
‘bufler-switch-buffer’
     Switch to a buffer selected from the frame’s workspace.  With
     prefix, select from all buffers and change the frame’s workspace.
‘bufler-frame-workspace’
     Set the frame’s workspace.  Setting the workspace is done
     automatically by bufler-switch-buffer, but this command may be used
     to set the workspace to a group containing other groups, after
     which bufler-switch-buffer will present buffers from the selected
     group and its subgroups.
‘bufler-buffer-workspace’
     Set the current buffer’s workspace name.  With prefix, unset it.
     Note that, in order for a buffer to appear in a named workspace,
     the buffer must be matched by an ‘auto-workspace’ group before any
     other group.

3.1 Bindings
============

In the Bufler buffer list, these keys are available (use C-h m to get
the most up-to-date listing).  They operate on all buffers in the
section at point.

   • 1 – 4 Cycle section levels at point.
   • M-1 – M-4 Cycle top-level sections.
   • RET Pop to buffer.
   • f Make a new frame for the group at point.
   • g Refresh Bufler list.
   • k Kill buffers.
   • s Save buffers.

3.2 Defining groups
===================

_See the bufler info page to view this information in Emacs._

   The Bufler groups definition is a list stored in variable
bufler-groups.  Each element of the list is either a lambda function
which takes a single argument, a buffer, or a list of such functions.
Each buffer is matched against these functions in order until it does
not match any more functions at that level.  A list of functions defines
a subgroup which short-circuits other groups at the same level,
preventing further grouping outside of the subgroup’s functions.
Ultimately, it’s lambdas all the way down.

   This seems somewhat difficult to explain, so please see the examples.
Once you get the hang of it, it’s powerful and flexible.

   For convenience, the macro bufler-defgroups provides a sort of DSL, a
concise vocabulary for defining groups.  For example, the default groups
are defined like this:

     (bufler-defgroups
       (group
        ;; Subgroup collecting all named workspaces.
        (auto-workspace))
       (group
        ;; Subgroup collecting all `help-mode' and `info-mode' buffers.
        (group-or "*Help/Info*"
                  (mode-match "*Help*" (rx bos "help-"))
                  (mode-match "*Info*" (rx bos "info-"))))
       (group
        ;; Subgroup collecting all special buffers (i.e. ones that are not
        ;; file-backed), except `magit-status-mode' buffers (which are allowed to fall
        ;; through to other groups, so they end up grouped with their project buffers).
        (group-and "*Special*"
                   (lambda (buffer)
                     (unless (or (funcall (mode-match "Magit" (rx bos "magit-status"))
                                          buffer)
                                 (funcall (mode-match "Dired" (rx bos "dired"))
                                          buffer)
                                 (funcall (auto-file) buffer))
                       "*Special*")))
        (group
         ;; Subgroup collecting these "special special" buffers
         ;; separately for convenience.
         (name-match "**Special**"
                     (rx bos "*" (or "Messages" "Warnings" "scratch" "Backtrace") "*")))
        (group
         ;; Subgroup collecting all other Magit buffers, grouped by directory.
         (mode-match "*Magit* (non-status)" (rx bos (or "magit" "forge") "-"))
         (auto-directory))
        ;; Subgroup for Helm buffers.
        (mode-match "*Helm*" (rx bos "helm-"))
        ;; Remaining special buffers are grouped automatically by mode.
        (auto-mode))
       ;; All buffers under "~/.emacs.d" (or wherever it is).
       (dir user-emacs-directory)
       (group
        ;; Subgroup collecting buffers in `org-directory' (or "~/org" if
        ;; `org-directory' is not yet defined).
        (dir (if (bound-and-true-p org-directory)
                 org-directory
               "~/org"))
        (group
         ;; Subgroup collecting indirect Org buffers, grouping them by file.
         ;; This is very useful when used with `org-tree-to-indirect-buffer'.
         (auto-indirect)
         (auto-file))
        ;; Group remaining buffers by whether they're file backed, then by mode.
        (group-not "*special*" (auto-file))
        (auto-mode))
       (group
        ;; Subgroup collecting buffers in a version-control project,
        ;; grouping them by directory.
        (auto-project))
       ;; Group remaining buffers by directory, then major mode.
       (auto-directory)
       (auto-mode))

   *Note* that the macro does not _set_ the variable bufler-groups, it
merely expands a groups form, so you should use, e.g.  ‘(setf
bufler-groups (bufler-defgroups ...))’ to actually set the groups.

   The following group types are available in bufler-defgroups.  Note
that each one is expanded into a lambda, so they may also be called by
funcall (see example above).

‘Meta types’
     These types compose multiple of the other types into a single
     group.
        • ‘group (TYPE...)’ Define a subgroup matching given types,
          which short-circuits other groups at the same level.
        • ‘group-not (NAME TYPE)’ Groups buffers which do _not_ match
          the given type.
        • ‘group-and (NAME TYPE...)’ Groups buffers which match all of
          the given types.
        • ‘group-or (NAME TYPE...)’ Groups buffers which match any of
          the given types.
‘Auto-types’
     These types automatically create groups for the buffer’s attribute
     of this type.
        • ‘auto-directory’ Buffer’s directory.
        • ‘auto-file’ Buffer’s file name.
        • ‘auto-hidden’ Whether the buffer is hidden.
        • ‘auto-indirect’ Whether the buffer is indirect (e.g.  a cloned
          indirect buffer).
        • ‘auto-mode’ Buffer’s major mode.
        • ‘auto-project’ Buffer’s version-control project directory
          according to ‘project.el’.
        • ‘auto-special’ Whether the buffer is special (i.e.  whether
          its name starts with ‘*’).
        • ‘auto-tramp’ Whether the buffer is opened via Tramp.
        • ‘auto-workspace’ The buffer’s named workspace, if any.
‘Regexp types’
     These types match a value against a buffer’s attribute and group
     buffers which match.
        • ‘name-match (NAME REGEXP)’ Match a regular expression against
          the buffer’s name.
        • ‘mode-match (NAME REGEXP)’ Match a regular expression against
          the buffer’s major-mode.
‘Other types’
        • ‘dir (DIRS DEPTH)’ Groups buffers which match one of the given
          DIRS. DIRS may be one or a list of directory paths.  DEPTH may
          be nil or a depth above which to produce subdirectory groups
          (a feature probably broken at the moment).  See example above.

4 Compared to Ibuffer
*********************

Bufler is primarily about grouping buffers automatically and
dynamically, using smart, customizeable rules.  While Ibuffer provides
some powerful grouping features, they are restricted to single-level
grouping, and they require extensive, manual configuration.  Bufler
offers recursive, multi-level grouping, and a set of default groups is
provided which are designed to be generally useful.  Bufler presents
groups in bufler-list using the magit-section library, which allows
groups and buffers to be toggled, marked, and operated on with commands.

   Ibuffer groups must be manually and individually specified.  So, for
example, to group project A’s buffers into one group, and project B’s
into another, Ibuffer requires the user to make a group for each
project.  Bufler provides a set of automatic grouping rules that create
groups automatically.  For example, auto-project automatically creates
groups per-project, so the user would only have to specify
‘(auto-project)’, and Bufler would create one group for project A’s
buffers and another for project B’s.  When those projects’ buffers are
closed, the groups are automatically removed.

   Bufler also provides optional workspace features in the form of
bufler-mode, which helps focus a frame on a group of buffers.  When it’s
active, the command bufler-switch-buffer presents buffers from that
frame’s selected workspace; when called with a prefix argument, it
presents all buffers, and then switches the frame’s workspace to the
selected buffer’s group.

   Of course, Ibuffer is a mature tool with many features, so Bufler
doesn’t replace it completely.  Bufler is a very young project.

   A workflow using Bufler could be something like this:

  1. Start Emacs.
  2. Activate bufler-mode.
  3. Open some buffers, find some files, etc.
  4. When you need to switch buffers, use M-x bufler-switch-buffer.  The
     buffers are presented by group with their "outline paths," which
     makes it easier to find the buffer you’re looking for, since
     they’re organized by project, directory, mode, etc.
  5. The next time you call bufler-switch-buffer in that frame, it will
     only offer buffers from that frame’s buffer group, making it easier
     to find buffers related to the current project.  Or if you need to
     select a buffer in a different group, use C-u with
     bufler-switch-buffer to see all buffers.  (Of course, existing
     commands like switch-to-buffer are not affected; Bufler doesn’t
     interfere with other modes or commands.)
  6. Make a new frame for a different project by using bufler-list to
     show the list of buffer groups, then selecting a group and pressing
     f to make the frame, which will be automatically set to that
     group’s workspace.
  7. When you need to kill or save a bunch of buffers at once, use
     bufler-list, put the cursor on a group you want to kill or save,
     and press k or s.  If you want to see which buffers have unsaved
     (indicated with *) or uncommitted (indicated with edited) changes,
     you can browse through the list of buffers (enable bufler-vc-state
     to show VC state for each buffer; this is disabled by default
     because getting up-to-date information on a buffer’s VC state can
     be slow).

   Then, you can write your own buffer-grouping rules to make them as
simple or as complex as you like.  They’re just Lisp functions, so you
can do anything with them, but the DSL provided by the macro makes
simple ones easy to write.
