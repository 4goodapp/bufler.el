* Plans
** 0.3
*** TODO Multiple Bufler buffers

i.e. call Bufler like ~(bufler :groups GROUPS :buffer-name "*Matrix Bufler*")~, and those variables should be set buffer-locally, and refreshing should use those values instead of the global ones.  That would allow multiple, unique Bufler buffers.
*** TODO Use =group-tree-defmacro=

Was working fine in the prototype, so it should work fine here too.  But I want to release 0.2 before making any changes like this.
** 0.4
*** TODO Buffer/group sorting

The WIP branch works pretty well already.
** 0.5
*** TODO Sortable columns


** 0.6
*** TODO Factor out GUI code

There should be a companion library to =group-tree= that provides the section-based view with columns.
* Ideas
** DONE Name
*** Bufler

Sort of like "buffer butler."  Maybe a buffalo for a mascot?

...Yep, works great!

*** Mr. Buffer

Sort of cute and catchy.  Maybe some clip art available.
