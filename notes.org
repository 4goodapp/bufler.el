#+PROPERTY: logging nil

* Plans

** 0.2

*** TODO Prefix to =bufler-list= to clear cache

Sometimes changing =bufler-groups= doesn't seem to take effect because =buffer-list= hasn't changed and =bufler-buffers= is cached.

*** TODO Explain the big 4 features
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2f7ddcb5-906d-4586-8a86-d21a09b2cf36
:END:

I think the big 4 features now are basically:

1.  =bufler-list=
2.  =bufler-switch-buffer=
3.  =bufler-workspace-mode=
4.  =bufler-tabs-mode=

And while they all work together, they can also be used independently.  =bufler-list= and =bufler-switch-buffer= don't even require =bufler-workspace-mode= to be activated.

** 0.3

*** TODO Multiple Bufler buffers

i.e. call Bufler like ~(bufler :groups GROUPS :buffer-name "*Matrix Bufler*")~, and those variables should be set buffer-locally, and refreshing should use those values instead of the global ones.  That would allow multiple, unique Bufler buffers.

*** TODO Rename some things

e.g. the grouping rules should probably be =rules= rather than =groups=, to distinguish the rules from the groups of buffers that they produce.

*** TODO Use =group-tree-defmacro=

Was working fine in the prototype, so it should work fine here too.  But I want to release 0.2 before making any changes like this.

*** TODO Keyword arguments to groups

e.g. instead of:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(group-not "*Special*" (group ...) ...)
#+END_SRC

Something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(group-not :name "*Special*" (group ...) ...)
#+END_SRC

Which should also allow:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(group-not (group ...) ...)
#+END_SRC

That would provide a lot of flexibility.

*** TODO Try to improve vc-state

Here's a common scenario:

1.  =bufler-list=.
2.  Switch to a buffer showing a file in a project.
3.  Make changes, save file, switch to =magit-status=, commit.
4.  =bufler-list=.  Even though the file is now up-to-date, it shows as =edited= because =vc-state= only gets updated when the buffer is saved, and the buffer hasn't been saved since it was committed.

Unfortunately, calling =vc-state-refresh= every time =bufler-list= is updated seems far too slow.

** 0.4

*** TODO Buffer/group sorting

The WIP branch works pretty well already.

** 0.5

*** TODO Sortable columns


** 0.6

*** TODO Factor out GUI code

There should be a companion library to =group-tree= that provides the section-based view with columns.

* Ideas

** DONE Name

*** Bufler

Sort of like "buffer butler."  Maybe a buffalo for a mascot?

...Yep, works great!

*** Mr. Buffer

Sort of cute and catchy.  Maybe some clip art available.
